This program imports math
The program then defines a function to get the users name by setting it to what the user inputed
It then asks the user if this is their name
Then we ask the user for their name in the main program
Then the function runs

We then define a function to calculate the pythagorsas theorem based on the parameters ap and bp
This then converts ap and bp
Then it calculates the square root and displays this to the user

the running secion of this code is cut out


Then the function for adding numbers is defined with paramters x and y
This then displays what each number is
Then it adds them together
x is defined outside the function
y is defined outside the function

the run section of this fucntion is cut out
